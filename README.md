Templates
=========

This library contains various extractor (\*.use) and transformer (\*.trs) templates that can be used for integrating Exivity with almost any usage API. Some examples are: Azure CSP, Azure Stack, VMware, Amazon Web Services (AWS), and many others.

Frequent updates will be done to this repository, when field engineers have integrated new vendors, or when users of Exivity have commited code to add new or improve existing templates.

Please consult https://docs.exivity.com/ to learn how to use these templates with Exivity. For questions, feel free to drop us an e-mail at: support@exivity.com.
