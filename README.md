# USE Extraction Templates
This library contains various USE Extractor Templates, that can be used for integrating the Exivity software with almost any usage API. Some examples are: Azure CSP, Azure Stack, VMware, Amazon Web Services (AWS), and many others.

Frequent updates will be done to this repository, when Field Engineers have integrated new vendors, or when users of the Exivity software have commited code to add new or improve existing Extractors.

Please consult https://docs.exivity.com/ to learn how to use these templates with the Exivity software solution. For questions, feel free to drop us an e-mail at: support@exivity.com
